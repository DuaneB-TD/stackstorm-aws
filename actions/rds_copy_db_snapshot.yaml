  SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier:
    type: string
    description: "The identifier for the source DB snapshot. If the source snapshot is in the same region as the copy, specify a valid DB snapshot identifier. For example, rds:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805.  If the source snapshot is in a different region than the copy, specify a valid DB snapshot ARN. For example, arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805.  If you are copying from a shared manual DB snapshot, this parameter must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB snapshot.  If you are copying an encrypted snapshot this parameter must be in the ARN format for the source region, and must match the SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier in the PreSignedUrl parameter.  Constraints:   Must specify a valid system snapshot in the 'available' state.   Example: rds:mydb-2012-04-02-00-01  Example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805 "

  KmsKeyId:
    type: string
    description: "The AWS KMS key ID for an encrypted DB snapshot. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.  If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from your AWS account, you can specify a value for this parameter to encrypt the copy with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the copy of the DB snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB snapshot.  If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot that is shared from another AWS account, then you must specify a value for this parameter.  If you specify this parameter when you copy an unencrypted snapshot, the copy is encrypted.  If you copy an encrypted snapshot to a different AWS region, then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the region that they are created in, and you cannot use encryption keys from one region in another region. "

  CopyTags:
    type: boolean
    description: "True to copy all tags from the source DB snapshot to the target DB snapshot; otherwise false. The default is false."
  PreSignedUrl:
    type: string
    description: "The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CopyDBSnapshot API action in the source AWS region that contains the source DB snapshot to copy.  You must specify this parameter when you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from another AWS region by using the Amazon RDS API. You can specify the source region option instead of this parameter when you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from another AWS region by using the AWS CLI.  The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBSnapshot API action that can be executed in the source region that contains the encrypted DB snapshot to be copied. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:     DestinationRegion - The AWS Region that the encrypted DB snapshot will be copied to. This region is the same one where the CopyDBSnapshot action is called that contains this presigned URL.  For example, if you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 region to the us-east-1 region, then you will call the CopyDBSnapshot action in the us-east-1 region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CopyDBSnapshot action in the us-west-2 region. For this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 region.     KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB snapshot in the destination region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBSnapshot action that is called in the destination region, and the action contained in the presigned URL.     SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier - The DB snapshot identifier for the encrypted snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 region, then your SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20161115.    To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process. "
  OptionGroupName:
    type: string
    description: "The name of an option group to associate with the copy.  Specify this option if you are copying a snapshot from one AWS region to another, and your DB instance uses a non-default option group. If your source DB instance uses Transparent Data Encryption for Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, you must specify this option when copying across regions. For more information, see Option Group Considerations. "
  SourceRegion:
    type: string
    description: "The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied."
