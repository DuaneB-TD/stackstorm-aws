  StorageEncrypted:
    type: boolean
    description: "Specifies whether the DB cluster is encrypted."
  KmsKeyId:
    type: string
    description: "The KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster. The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are creating a DB cluster with the same AWS account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key. If the StorageEncrypted parameter is true, and you do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then Amazon RDS will use your default encryption key. AWS KMS creates the default encryption key for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default encryption key for each AWS region. If you create a Read Replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another region, you must set KmsKeyId to a KMS key ID that is valid in the destination region. This key is used to encrypt the Read Replica in that region."
  PreSignedUrl:
    type: string
    description: "A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CreateDBCluster action to be called in the source region where the DB cluster will be replicated from. You only need to specify PreSignedUrl when you are performing cross-region replication from an encrypted DB cluster. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBCluster API action that can be executed in the source region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:    KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination region. This should refer to the same KMS key for both the CreateDBCluster action that is called in the destination region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.    DestinationRegion - The name of the region that Aurora Read Replica will be created in.    ReplicationSourceIdentifier - The DB cluster identifier for the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 region, then your ReplicationSourceIdentifier would look like Example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1.   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see  Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) and  Signature Version 4 Signing Process."
