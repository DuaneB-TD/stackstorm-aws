  SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier:
    type: string
    description: "The identifier of the DB cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is not case-sensitive. You cannot copy an encrypted, shared DB cluster snapshot from one AWS region to another. Constraints:   Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.   First character must be a letter.   Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.   Must specify a valid system snapshot in the 'available' state.   If the source snapshot is in the same region as the copy, specify a valid DB snapshot identifier.   If the source snapshot is in a different region than the copy, specify a valid DB cluster snapshot ARN. For more information, go to  Copying a DB Snapshot or DB Cluster Snapshot.   Example: my-cluster-snapshot1 "

  TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier:

    description: "The identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot to create from the source DB cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case-sensitive. Constraints:   Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.   First character must be a letter.   Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.   Example: my-cluster-snapshot2 "

  KmsKeyId:
    type: string
    description: "The AWS KMS key ID for an encrypted DB cluster snapshot. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.  If you copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, Amazon RDS encrypts the target DB cluster snapshot using the specified KMS encryption key.  If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your AWS account, you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to encrypt the copy with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId, then the copy of the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot.  If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from another AWS account, then you must specify a value for KmsKeyId.  To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot to another region, you must set KmsKeyId to the KMS key ID you want to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the region that they are created in, and you cannot use encryption keys from one region in another region."
  PreSignedUrl:
    type: string
    description: "The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot API action in the AWS region that contains the source DB cluster snapshot to copy. The PreSignedUrl parameter must be used when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS region. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBSClusterSnapshot API action that can be executed in the source region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:    KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action that is called in the destination region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.    DestinationRegion - The name of the region that the DB cluster snapshot will be created in.    SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 region, then your SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115.   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see  Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) and  Signature Version 4 Signing Process."
